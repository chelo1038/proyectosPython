# INITIAL STATE
# some place where we begin
# ACTIONS
#ome sort of action that we can take
#or multiple actions that we can take in any given state,


# TRANSITION MODEL 
#some way of defining
#what happens when we go from one state and take one action,

# GOAL TEST
# we need some goal test to know whether or not we've reached a goal.

# PATH COST FUNCTION 
# we need a path cost function that tells us for any particular path,
# by following some sequence of actions, how expensive is that path.

# NODE
# a data structure that keeps track of...
# -state
# -a parent (node that generated this node)
# -an antion (action applied to parent to get this node)
# -path cost (from initial state to node)

#
#class node():
    # def_init_(self, satate, parent, action):
    # self.state =state 
    # self.parent = parent 
    # self.action =action
    
    
    # class stackFrontier():
    #     def __init__(self):

#for i in lista:
   # if i > suma:
       #listaPares.append(i)
        
#lista.sort()
#lista.reverse()
